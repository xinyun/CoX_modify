What's CoX ?
-----
 CoX is the definition of a group of interface function.
 It defines the functional access functions of MCU's common peripherals, 
 such as I2C, SPI, UART, etc.


 **CoX Peripheral Library can be divided into four parts:**
 - Common mandatory type interface.
 - Common type of non-mandatory interface.
 - MCU-specific interface.
 - MCU register interface.
